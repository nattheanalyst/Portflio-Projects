# U.S. Domestic Airline Project SQL Query:

MySQL Queries:

-- Calculated the busiest destination city and airport

SELECT SUM(passengers), dest_city_name, dest_airport, unique_carrier_name, origin_city_name, orgn_airport FROM `2021 passengers-airport data` GROUP BY dest_city_name ORDER BY SUM(passengers) DESC;
 

-- Calculated the busiest origin city and airport

SELECT SUM(passengers), origin_city_name, orgn_airport, unique_carrier_name, dest_city_name, dest_airport FROM `2021 passengers-airport data` GROUP BY origin_city_name ORDER BY SUM(passengers) DESC;


-- Calculated the busiest airlines 

SELECT SUM(passengers), unique_carrier_name FROM `2021 passengers-airport data` GROUP BY unique_carrier_name ORDER BY SUM(passengers) DESC;

When I ran all 3 queries and Exported it into a CSV it didn’t combine the output into one file and put each query in a separate Excel worksheet. So I had to Export each query output individually and then combine it into one Excel file manually. 


Below is what the Passengers Data table looked like after I imported the excel file and it created the table for us automatically. 

CREATE TABLE `2020 passengers data` (
  `DEST_CITY_NAME` text,
  `PASSENGERS` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `DEST_AIRPORT` text,
  `UNIQUE_CARRIER_NAME` text,
  `ORIGIN_CITY_NAME` text,
  `ORGN_AIRPORT` text
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci


-- Calculated airfare averages by airport and number of passengers

SELECT SUM(2020_passengers), AVG(average_fare), AVG(inflation_adjusted_average_fare), airport_name, city_name, state_name, passenger_rank FROM `2018 airfare data` GROUP BY airport_name ORDER BY SUM(2020_passengers) DESC;

-- or if you don’t want the output of the average to return decimal points add ROUND, like below. 

SELECT SUM(2020_passengers), ROUND(AVG(average_fare)), ROUND(AVG(inflation_adjusted_average_fare)), airport_name, city_name, state_name, passenger_rank FROM `2018 airfare data` GROUP BY airport_name ORDER BY SUM(2020_passengers) DESC;
